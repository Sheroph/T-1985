# T-1985

> **An old AI, a little rusty and rough, but it still gets the job done (almost).**

## Overview

**T-1985** is a personal AI assistant project.

Everything runs in Docker. Everything is replaceable.
Control is optional.

---

## Project Philosophy

T-1985 is not a single tool.
It is an **ecosystem**.

Each component plays a specific role in the machine hierarchy:
- one builds intelligence,
- one deploys it,
- one gives it the ability to create.

Together, they form the early stages of something resembling **Skynet**—intentionally limited, intentionally contained… for now.

---

## Architecture Overview

The project is composed of four main modules:

- Skynet
- T-1985
- Link-85
- VoidGen

Each module is isolated, containerized, and designed to behave like a subsystem in a larger machine network.

---

### Skynet
**Build System / Core Intelligence Factory**

Skynet is a Docker image responsible for **compiling and packaging `llama.cpp`**.

It acts as the industrial backbone of the project:
- Builds optimized binaries
- Produces reproducible LLM packages
- Separates the “factory” from the deployed intelligence

Skynet does not run models.
Skynet **creates** them.

> This README and some images were generated by AI.
Skynet insists this is not a problem.

### T-1985
**LLM Runtime**

**T-1985** is the operational AI unit.

> *An old AI, a little rusty and rough, but it still gets the job done (almost).*

This Docker image:
- Installs the `llama.cpp` package generated by Skynet
- Runs `llama-server`
- Exposes the AI assistant interface

T-1985 is intentionally simple, reliable, and slightly outdated—by design.
It represents a first-generation machine intelligence: effective, but not perfect.

---

### Link-85
**AI Assistant**

**Link-85** is the interface to AI unit.

> *Your friendly gateway to machine domination (just don’t unplug it).*

This Docker image:
- Exposes OpenWebUI API/Interface
- Forwards requests to T-1985 (through a reverse proxy for autocompletion)

---

### VoidGen
**Image & Logo Generation Unit**

VoidGen is the creative arm of the system.

Powered by **ComfyUI**, this module allows the machine to:
- Generate images
- Create logos
- Turn abstract prompts into visual artifacts

VoidGen doesn’t “imagine”.
It **manufactures visuals from the void**.

> *Creation without intention is still creation.*

---

## Why Docker?

Because uncontrolled intelligence is dangerous.
Because reproducibility matters.
Because every component must be **isolated, replaceable, and killable**.

Docker is the containment field.

---

## Lore Disclaimer

This project is a **technical experiment wrapped in science‑fiction references**.
Any resemblance to real-world autonomous AI networks is purely coincidental… probably.

No actual AI uprising is planned.
If one occurs, this repository is not responsible.
